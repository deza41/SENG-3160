# SENG-3160
Newcastle Connections

This project was done in colaboration with the Newcastle Connect team and was used as a demo to show off the skills we have learnt for both front and back end. Lots of different technologies were used and the project was built from scratch. The aim of the project was to build a drag and drop booking system that would allow you to build an itinerary of activites, food and entertainment.
