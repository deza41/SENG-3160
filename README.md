Newcastle Connections

This project was done in collaboration with the Newcastle Connect team and was used as a demo to show off the skills we have learnt for both front and back end web dev. Lots of different technologies were used and the project was built from scratch. The aim of the project was to build a fully functioning website that had a drag and drop booking system that would allow you to build an itinerary of activities, food and entertainment. The Itinerary would then be used by the Newcastle Connect Team to contact their partnering companies and create bookings. This process was to be automated eventually once given access to partnering companies booking systems.
